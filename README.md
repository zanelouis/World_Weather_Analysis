# World_Weather_Analysis

## Project Overview
We used the data from PlanMyTrip and weather patterns to predict and analyze trends regarding ideal Hotel picks for Jack and team.

1. Use the NumPy module to generate more than 1,500 random latitudes and longitudes.
2. Use the citipy module to list the nearest city to the latitudes and longitudes.
3. Use the OpenWeatherMap API to request the current weather data from each unique city in your list.
4. Parse the JSON data from the API request.
5. Collect the following data from the JSON file and add it to a DataFrame:
  -City, country, and date
  -Latitude and longitude
  -Maximum temperature
  -Humidity
  -Cloudiness
  -Wind speed
